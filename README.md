# Game_Hangman
It is a puzzle game to ask the user to guess a word with 8 times chance. Have fun!

This is a little project I have launched in the online python course by MIT, and the game is wirtten in python3. The computer will randomly select one word from "word.txt" and tell the user the length of the word.

If you are also interested in learning python, I recommed you the edX online course platform (https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2017_2/course/), which you can do all the exercises even you only audit the course.
